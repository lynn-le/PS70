    <p>Here are my ideas:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Idea 1: A smart nail inventory
                    <p>This project is a smart inventory system for nail gel products that combines physical storage with electronics and a simple web interface. 
                    Because nail gel bottles come in many different shapes and sizes, the project focuses on designing a custom 3D-printed storage system that can adapt to these variations. 
                    Each bottle would sit in a holder with sensors to track whether it is present and roughly how much product remains. 
                    A microcontroller would manage this inventory data and send it to a website that displays current stock levels and highlights when products are running low. </p>
                </li>
                <li>Idea 2: spice tracker
                    <p>This project is a smart spice organizer that tracks which spices are used during cooking. 
                        The system would be designed as a custom 3D-printed spice rack that can accommodate a certain amount of jars, with some sort of sensor to track weight. 
                        When a cooking session is initiated, the organizer records interactions with individual spice containers to log which spices are used. 
                        A microcontroller manages this data and communicates it through simple outputs or a website, allowing users to review what ingredients were used during a meal. 
                        The project focuses on the relationship between physical design, sensing, and microcontroller programming to support lightweight ingredient tracking in the kitchen.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Idea 3: Drink Assistant
                    <p>This project is a drink assistant that helps customize and prepare a drink based on user preferences. 
                        The system asks for inputs such as temperature, sweetness level, or drink type using simple physical controls like buttons or a dial. 
                        Based on these preferences, a microcontroller controls a small pouring or dispensing mechanism to assemble the drink. 
                        The project would involve designing and fabricating a custom 3D-printed structure to hold containers, tubing, and electronics, as well as integrating sensors and outputs to guide the interaction.
                        Depending on the difficulty of implementation, the assistant may save user profiles as well for calibration.
                    </p>
